# Reflecting on the Creation of The Legend of Zelda: Rift in Spacetime

## Did everything in my needs-to-have list get accomplished?
- Not quite, but really close.
- Some things were done differently than what was proposed in the original proposal.md; such as life potions spawning instead of treasure chests, as treasure chests are not in the original The Legend of Zelda for the NES.
- I ended up not getting to the enemy hunting down the player upon seeing them, as well as equip menu buttons having a function, and I do wish that I added collision for Link's sword, but aside from that, everything in my needs-to-have list is complete.

## What was the hardest part in creating the project?
- There's two I specifically have in mind; room generation, as it took the entirety of assignments 1-3 to generate something I was satisfied with, but from an actual difficulty perspective, killing off an enemy from battle, especially when you are fighting multiple enemies at once, was the greatest struggle.

## What advice would I give myself in regards to this project?
- To not think too big and not prepare for nice to haves that might not ever happen; I should have focused on making sure all of the needs to have tasks were complete before touching the nice to have tasks.

## Was there any problems I could not solve?
- One thing I could not solve in time was making the equip and swap buttons functional; more because I ran out of time rather than didn't know how to complete it.
- For everything else I attempted, I was able to finish it and make it functional.
